## Analyze Your Strengths and Weaknesses by Phases
The easiest way to do this is by making a well-known division of your game into 3 phases – the Opening, Middlegame, and Endgame. If you’re achieving terrible positions in the opening – why would you spend time studying endgames first? A logical progression of study would seem to generate better overall results. This process is not meant to disregard the other phases of the game, more to say that a well-thought, balanced plan of development as a chess player is the most efficient and effective method.

For example, once you have identified your strengths in the Opening phase you will be able to more efficiently study the resulting middle and endgame positions. This provides a well-rounded strategy for short-term and long-term development as a chess player. Identify what you are good at (and enjoy) and capitalize on this strength (opportunity). On the flip side, identifying honestly your weaknesses will enable you to improve them or avoid similar positions altogether. Bettering your decision-making process and developing a balanced strategy for improvement (as a chess player) is only made possible through genuinely honest and objective reflection and evaluation. As you gain more information throughout this process, it is essential to adapt your decisions to the changing information that they should be based on.

## Always Check and Balance Your Opportunities and Threats
Beginner chess players have a tendency to jump at a quick opportunity to win an extra pawn or dive into a trap or gambit without seeing the true outcome. In business the SWOT analysis isn’t only about seeing your opportunities and threats but comparing them against each other. Chess is very useful in training a business mind in this aspect because a beginner entrepreneur may also jump into a potential opportunity without properly balancing out the risks and threats. A true chess master will always carefully analyze both opportunities and threats, and combine it with his known strengths and weaknesses to result in the best analytical decision.
